## What is TextForge?

TextForge is a text-processing DSL that executes **sequential pipelines of single-purpose instructions**. Each instruction performs exactly one transformation on the input text, and instructions chain one after another — the output of each step becomes the input of the next.

```
"  hello world  " → tbs → raw world Rust → tua → "HELLO RUST"
```

On top of that linear pipeline, TextForge also has a small amount of **control flow**:

- **Blocks** (`blk` / `cblk`) — group a set of instructions under a name and invoke them together, as many times as you want.
- **Conditionals** (`ifdc`) — run a group of instructions only if the input contains a given value.
- **Variables** (`val`) — store an immutable value in the pipeline's execution context so other instructions can reference it instead of a hardcoded literal.

Pipelines can be written in human-readable `.textforge` files, compiled to an optimized `.textforgebc` binary format, or composed directly in Rust via the `TextForgeBuilder` API. Native bindings (JS/Python) are on the roadmap but not yet available.

---

## Why TextForge?

- **Portable pipelines** — write a pipeline once, share it as a `.textforge` file, version it with Git, and audit it instruction by instruction.
- **Optimized binary format** — `.textforgebc` eliminates parsing overhead for production use cases.
- **Extensible by design** — adding a new instruction touches a small, fixed set of files and never modifies the core. The instruction set can scale to thousands without architectural changes.
- **Fluent Rust API** — compose pipelines directly in code via `TextForgeBuilder`/`TextForgeProcessor` without writing `.textforge` files.
- **Batch processing** — run a pipeline over many input files in parallel (powered by `rayon`).
- **Built-in observability (optional)** — the `watchers` feature lets you attach probes to a pipeline run and export a JSON report of what happened at each step.

## File Formats

| Format | Extension | Use case |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Text pipeline | `.textforge` | Human-readable, editable, versionable |
| Binary pipeline | `.textforgebc` | Optimized for performance and distribution (`bytecode` feature) |

### `.textforge` Syntax

```textforge
// Comments start with //
// One instruction per line, ending with ;

tbs;
raw world Rust;
tua;
```

Arguments are split the same way a shell splits a command line, so quoting is optional unless an argument contains whitespace:

```textforge
atb "banana";
raw "banana" "laranja";
```

#### Control flow

```textforge
// Define a block named "block_1" by adding instructions to it, one `blk` line at a time
blk block_1 assoc dlf;
blk block_1 assoc dll;
blk block_1 assoc ins 5 "banana";

// Run every instruction in "block_1", in the order they were added
cblk block_1;
```

`val` declares an immutable variable in the execution context; other instructions can then reference it (by variable name) instead of a hardcoded literal. `ifdc` runs a group of instructions only if the current text contains a given value. Both are easiest to use through the Rust builder API for now — see [`TextForgeConditionalMethods`](src/api/mod.rs) and [`TextForgeBlockMethods`](src/api/mod.rs).

---

## Quick Start

### As a Rust library

TextForge isn't on crates.io yet — add it as a git dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
textforge = { git = "https://github.com/redlintles/textforge" }
```

Use the builder API through a `TextForgeProcessor`:

```rust
use textforge::api::{
    textforge_processor::{ TextForgeProcessor, TextForgeProcessorMethods },
    TextForgeBuilderMethods,
};

let mut processor = TextForgeProcessor::new();

let id = processor
    .create_pipeline()
    .trim_both_sides()?
    .replace_all_with("world", "Rust")?
    .to_uppercase_all()?
    .build();

let result = processor.process_all(&id, "  hello world  ")?;
assert_eq!(result, "HELLO RUST");
```

### From a `.textforge` file (CLI)

```bash
atp run pipeline.textforge --input "  hello world  "
```

> **Note:** The CLI is currently under development and not yet available. (The binary is still named `atp` internally; a couple of empty binary stubs for a future shell/game also exist but do nothing yet.)

|------|-------------|
| `default` | Core library, no CLI, no bytecode |
| `bytecode` | Enables the `.textforgebc` binary protocol and the CLI binary |
| `watchers` | Enables pipeline observability probes and JSON execution reports |
| `test_access` | Enables test helpers (`rand`, `random-string`, `tempfile`) and pulls in `bytecode`/`watchers` |

---

## Batch Processing

Pipelines can be run over many files in parallel via `TextForgeProcessor::process_batch`, which reads each input file, runs a registered pipeline against it, and writes the result to an output file — backed by `rayon` under the hood.

---

## Adding a New Instruction

TextForge is designed so that adding a new instruction never modifies the core. Involved files:

- Create `src/tokens/transforms/<mnemonic>/mod.rs` — instruction struct + `InstructionMethods` impl
- Create `src/tokens/transforms/<mnemonic>/test.rs` — unit tests
- Register the mnemonic in `src/globals/table.rs`
- Add the builder method in `src/api/mod.rs` (`TextForgeBuilderMethods`)

See [`instruction-design.md`](.agents/skills/atp-project/references/instruction-design.md) for the full guide with code templates.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. This repo currently doesn't have a root-level `CONTRIBUTING.md` — the instruction design pattern lives in [`.agents/skills/atp-project/`](.agents/skills/atp-project/) instead. *(If you'd rather have a standalone `CONTRIBUTING.md` again, let me know and I'll draft one from that content.)*

All commits, code, and documentation should be in **English**.
